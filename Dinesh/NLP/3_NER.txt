#Theory :-


# NER stands for Named Entity Recognition, a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP). It involves identifying and classifying named entities (such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, numerical expressions, etc.) in text and categorizing them into predefined categories.

# The primary goal of NER is to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into categories such as:

# Person: Names of people or characters.
# Organization: Names of companies, institutions, etc.
# Location: Names of places, cities, countries, etc.
# Date: Temporal expressions like dates, months, years, etc.
# Time: Specific time mentions.
# Percent: Percentage expressions.
# Money: Monetary expressions.
# Miscellaneous: Anything that doesn't fall into the above categories.
# For instance, in the sentence: "Apple Inc. is located in Cupertino, California, and was founded by Steve Jobs," NER would identify:

# Organization: "Apple Inc."
# Location: "Cupertino, California"
# Person: "Steve Jobs"
