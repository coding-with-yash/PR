#Dependency parsing is a linguistic analysis technique used in natural language processing to uncover grammatical relationships between words in a sentence. It involves parsing a sentenceâ€™s structure to create a tree-like representation that shows how words depend on one another. 
# This helps reveal the syntactic structure, roles of words (like subSyntactic parsing, broader in scope, aims to uncover the overall syntactic structure of a sentence, encompassing phrase boundaries, constituents, and grammatical rules.
